Factory is an interactive project designed to demonstrate functions of basic components, such as Button, Display, Pipe, Picture, Progress Bar, for the visualization of a simple chemical production process. Four basic chemicals are mixed together in a boiler (the mixing ratio can be defined manually or via recipes). The final product is stored in a tank and fed to moving tank trucks. A truck is represented as a picture and a progress bar grouped together. The movement of the truck is achieved by dynamically changing the X coordinate using scripts.

At runtime, the project starts in the automatic mode (script-controlled), but you can switch the mode by clicking on the Manual mode button located on the bottom part of the visualization window. Based on the data table (database) to which all important process values are logged, you can easily create a trend or report.
